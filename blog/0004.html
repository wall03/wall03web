    <h1>Why did this take so long?</h1>
        <p>I basically finished working on the updated database system in November. Why did I not publish it? Because Oliver said that once we finished all (him, me, and Derin) of our personal projects, he would publish all of them.</p>
        <p>Then, he got a used enterprise server. It moved from "when we're done" to "once I set this up". After the server died, we abandoned that milestone and started working as a group of three, starting work on an ambitious project.</p>
    <h1>Twidilers</h1>
        <p>Twidilers was what Oliver called his website. However, it found it's use in the project us three started working on</p>
        <p>This project was a social media product. It was mostly to look good on our resumes for college, but it also taught us a lot of skills.</p>
        <p>I worked on the frontend, designing buttons and colors. It turned out okay, but over time we lost interest. After adding a bunch of features, we petered out over winter break, and I was the only one working on stuff</p>
    <h1>Where it stands</h1>
        <p>While I think that it definitely needs more work put into it, it will be published soonTM once I get MY server running (don't jinx it). I'll update this later if something changes</p>
