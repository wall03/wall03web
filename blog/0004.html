            <h1 class="title">i revisited this website and it looked like trash<a>.</a></h1>
            hello again! itza me, ya wall03!<br>
            i'm back after a month of inactivity, and i've made this website pop.<br>
            like it didn't pop before... but much more than <a href="0003.html">last time.</a> And last time popped more than <a href="0001.html">the time before.</a>

            <h1>what's new?</h1>
            so... you want to know what's new. that makes sense. here's what changed:
            <ol>
                <li>-lowercase... everywhere. it was rolled out to some places before, but is now everywhere. you can see the changes on places like the menu bar. so... yeah.</li>
                <li><br>-neumorphism design is everywhere. i used https://neumorphism.io/ to create the look. you can learn about neumorphism by googling it.</li>
                <li><br>-emoji icons in footnotes. i used a magic thing called unicode to make it work without uploading images.</li>
                <li><br>-animations. you'll now find them on menu items (scroll up).</li>
                <li><br>-i remembered there was such thing as light mode. i mean, i knew it was there before, but didn't want to turn my entire system to light mode. i found individual browser controls and now run ms edge for testing light mode to make sure that everything looks good.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h1>what to expect in the future<a>.</a></h1>
            don't expect me to do something. i don't have a schedule and don't plan to have one for releases. expect an update when i forget about this website than revisit it and revamp it. you can follow me on the ltt forum to see updates on design and prototypes.
