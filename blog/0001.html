			<h1>Hello!</h1>
				<p>Whew! It's been a long year. When was the last time I updated this website? According to my archive, the last release was <strong>October 11th, 2021. </strong>Shit.</p>
				<p>I've been working on this redesign off and on for <strong>almost a year.</strong> I started coding the site off and on in October of 2022. I collaborated with a much more capable web developer, .pi. .pi basically wrote this website, changing everything and deleting legacy code that bloats the size. I present to you, Revision 5 of my website.</p>
				<p>Let's see where we came from to where we are now. This is v1.1, from August of 2020.</p><img src="../img/v1.1.png">
				<p>This is v2, which has dark mode! Other then that, I added mobile responsiveness and more lowercase characters.</p><img src="../img/Screenshot 2023-04-04 at 12-13-38 hello i'm wall03!.png">
				<p>v3 added a touch of color to an otherwise black and white website. I also started playing around with rounded corners!</p><img src="../img/Screenshot 2023-04-04 at 12-15-43 home wall03.png">
				<p>Oh no. v4 was a complete failure. I added neomorphism because 'trendy' and whatnot, but it looks awful in dark mode. I regret this and I'm sorry for your eyes</p><img src="../img/Screenshot 2023-04-04 at 12-19-51 home wall03.png">
				<p>I started with minor updates to fix the mistakes. v4.2 removed neomorphism and added better mobile support</p>
				<p>This is where my archive stops, but I turn to Github for the rest. I uploaded from v4.6 onward (october 31st, 2021). v4.6 added a bluer background in dark mode, a consistent style for blog posts, a lighter page, and a redesign of the blog page.</p>
				<p>From there, all of the updates were minor enough to not mention, but you can always <a href="https://github.com/wall03/wall03web/commits/main">look at the Github page.</a></p>
			<h1>That brings us to today.</h1>
				<p>I started collaborating with <a href="https://github.com/ItsPi3141/">.pi</a> on the website via Discord and Github, and, Pi doing most of the heavy lifting, we came to something similar to this website. Then, for the next several months, I barely did any work on the site as I focused on cooler things like 3d printers and such. I then touched up this site and sent it out the world on April 4th, 2023.</p>
