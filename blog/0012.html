  <h1 class="title">home network update<a>.</a></h1>
  It's been a <a href="0008.html">long time</a> since I last posted about my home network but nevertheless changes have happened, so I decided to clump them all into one blog post. I also have some news about the next website update.<br>
  <h3>first, the network update.</h3>
    I have moved my computer to a different floor, and I needed to wire it. The place I was wiring it to happened to not have good WiFi, so I decided to bring two wires up. It worked and now my WiFi is faster and my computer is not where it was before.<br><br>

  <h3>and now for the website update</h3>
    I am currently working on a big redesign to the layout on desktop. Below is a preview of what I'm working on. It is still in development so the finished product will presumably look very different.<br><br>
