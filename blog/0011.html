  <h1 class="title">i went to Philidelphia<a>.</a></h1>
  Hey guys! Last Wednesday (Nov 10th) at around 2:45 I left for Philidelphia. 3 1/2 hrs later I arrived at my airBNB. Here's what happened after that.<br>

  <h1>lunch<a>.</a></h1>
    I couldn't go into Philidelphia without getting a cheese steak. So I got one. It was big, so I finished it for dinner on the way back home later that day.<br><br>

  <h1>drive home<a>.</a></h1>
    On my drive home, I spotted a familiar looking billboard. Is that... DuckDuckGo? The search engine I used for over 2 years (I switched to Startpage)? It was. <br><br>

  <h1>wait... that's it<a>?!</a></h1>
    I didn't take very many pictures that didn't involve people, and I don't have much else to say.
  <h1>no, it's not<a>.</a></h1>
    Ok, that last paragraph was a lie. I didn't have a very good time in Philly. Except for the food, I didn't really do very many exciting things. I went to IKEA and visited family. Those were the 2 main things. Not very exciting. I would rather go to NYC, which is much closer to my house and has more things to do.
