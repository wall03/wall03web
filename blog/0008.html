  <h1 class="title">the switch was broken. now it's not<a>.</a></h1>
i forgot to share that my switch arrived. i (obviously) have not detailed my experience with it, what happened to it, and what not.<br>
i am posting this blog post to share my experience, what i'm using the switch for and i also have a small story to tell.<br>
</div><br><br>

    <h1 id="mythoughts">my thoughts<a>.</a></h1>
    the switch is a 24 port 1gbps switch, which is plenty for me but it might not satisfy other peoples needs.<br>
    in my opinion the switch isn't very good looking, but it was designed to be locked away on a rack. i don't have a rack, so it went on a bookself.<br><br>

    <br>
    the switch is a huge upgrade over what i had, especially for what i paid for it ($50). i don't really need all 24 ports right now, but i will soon.<br><br>

    <h1>a story involving hp enterprise's rma process<a>.</a></h1>
    about a week after i got the switch, it started malfunctioning. i looked up what to do and i found that there was a hardware malfunction.
    i called hewlett-packard enterpise's rma line, and was transfered to someone who could actually help me. and then the line disconnected, 
    right before i got their phone number in case they got disconnected. i called the rma phone line again and found that no reps were available.
    the next day i called in again. no reps were available. this is a 24/7 line, too. i tried and tried again, and each and every time i called 
    no reps were available. i finally realized i could just file an rma online. i got a functioning switch and i shipped back the old switch.<br><br>
    did you know that hp enterprise is a completely seperate company from hp inc? i found that fact interesting, and i hope you do too.
