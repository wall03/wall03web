			<h1>Howdy!</h1>
				<p>It's been a hot minute. I've been hard at work at stuff like existing and things. Also I have a new update to this website, as well as a special announcement!</p>
				<p>Well, I'd like to first acknowledge how this website has had some dead links and an incomplete page, which was recently brought to my attention by a friend of mine.</p>
				<p>Over a month later, in peak wall fashion, I am finally finishing up my portfolio pages and updating things to make things more accurate and readying it for release! 
					I was looking into making this website public domain (cause I don't really care about intellectual property), and I'm pretty sure I can just say that it is. 
					I got consent from .pi, the wonderful helper who helped make the original update in April possible.</p>
			<h1>What to Expect</h1>
				<p>I'm hard at work on more epic projects/upgrades for this website including a hamburger menu and JavaScript tags for blog post sorting. 
					I'm also going to import some old blog posts and hopefully get around to actually posting about life and school. More to come sometime soon. (hopefully)</p>
