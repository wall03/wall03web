Wow! You're reading this. This is public domain. Do what you will with this. A work in progress. Completely hand-made.

## Version information
it's a.b.cG big.little.patch which is a recent change (as of 4/8/25)
G is something for storing blog posts. I don't hardcode them but it makes it easier to version control my blog posts. Once a 'little' update is published the letter gets reset

Some examples:
* v5.2 -> significant formatting changes that affect multiple pages
* v5.3 -> added blog database functionality -- took a while and added a lot
* v5.3a -> added blog post
* v5.3.1a -> 404 page fixed
* v5.3.2a -> fixed styling issue
* v5.3.3b -> formatting for stored blog posts, readme
