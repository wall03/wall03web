  <h1 class="title">let me tell you about myself<a>.</a></h1>
  Welcome to one of my best pieces of work - this website.<br>
  I am a male human being with interests in programming, writing, tech, privacy, design, video games, networking and memes.<br>
  For some weird reason, I find it soothing to buy office supplies and look at networking supplies.<br>
  Due to the fact I am privacy conscious, please note I won't be giving you much information about myself.<br>
  I am a person with a very low attention span and I often start working on something and abandon it and start working on something else.<br>

  <h1>now let me tell you about this website<a>.</a></h1>
  Once upon a time, everything was free for everyone to copy. Now, corporations are fighting for exclusive rights to their work for practically forever. I do not agree with these corporations and this website is now open source! Download or view it now by clicking <a href="https://github.com/wall03/wall03web" target="_blank">this link.</a> Oh! Also, below is a history of this website.
  <h3 id="redesign5">a new glorious blue coat of paint</h3>
  I have been slowly touching up this website since august and I think it's time to put all of the small changes in one update: bluer background in dark mode, all blog posts now look uniform, page loading time has decreased, and the blog page has a redesigned posts list with more tags.
  <h3 id="redesign4">flat is good now.</h3>
  An extensive amount of changes rolled out to this website on august 7th, 2021. the changes included badly needed updates to the layout on mobile, a flat design (neumorphism was scrapped) and a rearranged guide page. <a href="blog/0009.html">blog post.</a>
  <h3 id="redesign3">is that neumorphism????</h3>
  The april 2021 update of this website, which started development on april 4th, 2021, featured a design updated with neumorphism techniques, along with small updates such as some attention to the light version of the website, emojis, and some animations added to the menu bar. <a href="blog/0004.html">blog post.</a>
  <h3 id="redesign2">round'd and astound'd</h3>
  The march 2021 update featured color accents, an improved layout, an improved design, and rounded corners. <a href="blog/0003.html">blog post.</a>
  <h3 id="redesign1">the layout: reimagined</h3>
  This website had its first major redesign roll out in september of 2020. This redesign added dark mode. it also introduced a new layout, specialized mobile layout, and other improvements. It was the first time this design was based on all-lowercase philosophy, too. <a href="blog/0001.html">blog post.</a><br>
  <h3>creation</h3>
  This website was created on september 2nd, 2020. the design was very basic, and looked much different from today.
